# weather_app

- Objective: Create a small, functional weather app using React Native that demonstrates the candidate's ability to fetch data from an API, manage state, handle user input, and display results in a visually appealing manner.

- Instructions:

Set up a new React Native project using Expo or React Native CLI.
Integrate a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch the current weather conditions for a given location. You may need to sign up for a free API key.
Create a user interface with the following components:
A search bar or text input field for the user to enter a city name or ZIP code.
A button to submit the search query.
Display the current temperature, weather condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy, etc.), and an appropriate weather icon based on the fetched data.
Implement error handling for cases where the user input is invalid, or the API request fails.
Make sure the app is responsive and visually appealing across different screen sizes and orientations.
(Optional) Add a feature that allows users to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature display.
